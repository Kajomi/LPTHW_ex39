# LPTHW_ex39_europe
Part of Learn Python the Hard Way book - exercise 39 (Dictionaries, Oh Lovely Dictionaries)

Part of the study drills was to do the exercise to another region/ set of values. therefore, i am following the exercise but with a focus on Europe and have added some other stuff you can do with dictionaries.
