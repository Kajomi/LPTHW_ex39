# Learn Python the Hard Way - exercises and study drills
## Part of Learn Python the Hard Way book - exercises

As I try to learn Python I have focused on the *Learn Python the Hard Way* -book by Zed Shaw which contains 52 exercises with an aim to enable the student to grasp the basics of Python programming and to gain basic understanding of programming in general. 

  * I have put effort in the study drills as adviced by Zed in the book by trashing the code, adding new features, modifying the existing ones, etc.  

*Note: I have not uploaded all the exercises from the start of the book.*
