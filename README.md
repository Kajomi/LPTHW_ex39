# Learn Python the Hard Way - exercises and study drills
Part of Learn Python the Hard Way book - exercises

As I try to learn Python I have been doing the exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way -book by Zed Shaw. I have done lot of study drills as adviced by Zed in the book and have modified lot of the exercises as I have noticed it is easier for me to really 'get it' if having to figure out some stuff on my own and name the variables myself.
